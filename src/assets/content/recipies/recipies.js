      "4 corn on the cobs",
      "1/2 kg kent pumpkin",
      "1 red capsicum",
      "1 white onion",
      "1 garlic head",
      "1 large tomato",
      "1 teaspoon of cumin",
      "50ml vegetable stock",
      "100ml full cream milk",
      "2 tablespoons of olive oil",
      "250g stracchino cheese",
      "Salt and pepper to taste",
      "",
      "FOR FRITITO",

      "",
      "For Garnish:",
      "1 corn on the cob",
    ],
    steps: [
      "Preparing the Humita:",
      "Begin by grating the corn using the side of the grater with the smallest holes and place the grated corn and liquid produced into a bowl.",
      "Next, using the side of the grater with the largest holes, grate the pumpkin into the same bowl as the grated corn.",
      "In a large pot, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over a medium-high heat.",
      "While the oil is heating, finely dice the onion, garlic, and red capsicum.",
      "Add the diced onion, garlic, and capsicum to the pot. Sauté until they start to turn golden.",
      "Add the grated pumpkin and corn, along with the cumin, milk, vegetable stock and a pinch of salt and pepper.",
      "Reduce the heat to a minimum and cover the pot, allowing it to simmer for 10 minutes, stirring as needed. If the liquid reduces too much and the humita starts sticking to thebottom of the pot, add a dash of milk.",
      "While the humita simmers, cut one cob of corn in half, brush it with butter, and place it in the pre heated oven for 10 minutes, or until golden and charred.",
      "",
      "Preparing the Fritito (Chilli Oil):",
      "In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat.",
      "Next, add the finely diced spring onions, smoked paprika and chili flakes to the hot oil and immediately remove the pan from the heat.",
      "Season with salt and pepper, and stir for a few minutes. This will ensure that the spring onions don't burn and the flavours are well incorporated.",
      "To serve: Cut 4 cubes of a creamy cheese (i.e. stracchino) and place them at the bottom of a bowl.",
      "Place the humita on top of the cheese and add 3 more cubes of the cheese on top to melt in the humita.",
      "Take the charred corn from the oven and remove the kernels with a knife. Add some to the mixture of the humita and use the rest as garnish.",
      "Serve with you chipa and fritito on the side – ENJOY",
